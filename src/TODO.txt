 - Add log file. Verbosity?
 - Add language statement: C++17? 
 - Add list of tools used with versions: cmake, gcc, etc.
 - Add class to look for config file in local then home dirs.
 - Add ability to specify a set of bodies.
 - Fix/test ODE against 2BP.
 - Add, test force inside a sphere to 2bp force.
 - Make "orbit plot" configurable from json: limit, scaling.
 - Add ffmpeg movie creation
 - Multiple frame outputs per run - configurable
 - Made plots square
 - Add "tolower" function on strings for file handling on Windows

TO DO
 - Define range of random initial position, vel for DM.
 - Define fixed grid for DM IC.
 - Add density plot as option in frame generation.
 - Add path to use first order ODEs (e.g., RK4)
 - Add energy evaluation to show numerical stability.
 - Make movie viewer configurable
 - Compose frmes into one animation. 
 - Make animator frames follow a body.
 - Make animator frames orient to a axis (eg 3BP frame). [use a second body]
 - Have Animator sort out axes from input vector of point_types using indexes (eg can do y vs z)
