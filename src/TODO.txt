To do list

DONE
 - Add a copyright / licensing statement.
 - Pull run configuration into a JSON file.
 - Add confirmation output for configuration being read correctly?
 - Add log file. Verbosity?
 - Add language statement: C++17? 
 - Add list of tools used with versions: cmake, gcc, etc.
 - Add class to look for config file in local then home dirs.
 - Add ability to specify a set of bodies.
 - Fix/test ODE against 2BP.
 - Add, test force inside a sphere to 2bp force.
 - Make "orbit plot" configurable from json: limit, scaling.
 - Add ffmpeg movie creation
 - Multiple frame outputs per run - configurable
 - Made plots square
 - Add "tolower" function on strings for file handling on Windows
 - Added option to add grids of pos in XY for DM IC, same velocity.
 - Define range of random IC for pos and vel for DM.

TO DO
 - Add timer to measure when the sim is done
 - Add CPU threads to speed up force evaluation.
 - Add source and sink regions (windtunnel features).
 - Add note about maximum number of points.
 - Implement CUDA accelerated integration.
 - Add density plot as option in frame generation.
 - Add path to use first order ODEs (e.g., RK4)
 - Add energy evaluation to show numerical stability.
 - Make movie viewer configurable
 - Compose multiple frame streams into one animation. 
 - Make animator frames follow a body.
 - Make animator frames orient to a axis (eg 3BP frame). [use a second body]
 - Have Animator sort out axes from input vector of point_types using indexes (eg can do y vs z)
